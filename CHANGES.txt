Release 5.0.0
=============

This release introduces preliminary support for Python 3 with the Qt toolkit!

This is based in large part on the work of Yves Delley and Pradyun Gedam, but
also owes a lot to Ioannis Tziakos for implementing container-based continuous
integration and Prabhu Ramachandran and Corran Webster for tracking down the
few remaining bugs.  Python 3 support is probably not yet ready for production
use, but feedback and bug reports are welcome, and all future pull requests
will be expected to work with Python 3.4 and later.  Python 3 support requires
Traits 4.5 or greater, and TraitsUI 5.0 or greater.

This release also bring support for wxPython 3.0, while dropping support for
wxPython 2.6 and earlier.  There are also a couple of minor bug fixes detailed
below.

Finally, this release changes the default GUI toolkit from Wx to Qt.  This
changes the behaviour of the library in the case where both WxPython and
PyQt/PySide are installed and the user or code doesn't specify the toolkit to
use explicitly.

Change summary since 4.5.2
--------------------------

Features

* Experimental support for Python 3 (#160, #161, #162, #163).
* Experimental support for wxPython 3 (#168).

Enhancements

* Make Qt 4 the default GUI toolkit (#172).

Fixes

* Fix issue with reading unicode text from Qt clipboard (#159).
* Remove usage of `logging.warn` in favour of `logger.warning` (#167).

Release 4.5.2
=============

This release includes a large number of additions to the test suite that
provide at least basic smoke-test coverage of the core of the library.  There
has also been work done to improve the continuous integration testing of
the library.  Much more work needs to be done on this front, but the situation
is improving.

The process of adding these tests also discovered a number of minor bugs
which have been fixed.

Finally, this release warns that as of Pyface 5.0 the default GUI toolkit
will switch from Wx to Qt.  This future update will change the behaviour of
the library in the case where both WxPython and PyQt/PySide are installed and
the user or code doesn't specify the toolkit to use explicitly.
